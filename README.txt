N.B. Where you are told to run something, it will be enclosed with single quote marks, do not include these when you actually run it, for example, if something says "make sure you run 'cat icelandToWinEurovision2021.txt", in your terminal type:

$> cat icelandToWinEurovision2021.txt

Compilation instructions:
-------------------------
- This project is built using Maven, make sure you have Maven installed before doing anything!
- To build, run the JavaFX program and perform unit tests, you'll need to trigger the Maven `javafx:run` build target. (This means that you'll need to make sure you're in the main parent directory of the folder structure, then type 'mvn javafx:run').
